    # Nullable column with a default, so we can create a conditional, db-level
    # uniqueness constraint by taking advantage of the fact that null values are
    # treated as unique from other null values. See also app/models/project_submission.rb.
    # Note the default of "1" is an arbitrarily chosen non-null value.

    # Migrate existing records. If this migration still fails at the add_index step,
    # it means you have multiple is_submitted:false submissions for the same user/project,
    # which is *not valid*, and you should correct that manually and re-run this
    # migration.

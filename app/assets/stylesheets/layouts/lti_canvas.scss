 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add lti-canvas-wide styles, those that will appear in all pages shown when
 * launched in Canvas through the LTI Extension, to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

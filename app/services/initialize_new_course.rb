# Responsible for initializing a new Canvas course:
# 1. creates the initial Canvas Sections if specified
# 2. creates local projects, modules, etc for those found in the Canvas course
#
# Note: we discussed having the platform app be the place where all actions that required
# us to store information in our local database would go through a platform Course Management
# UI and then relying on the local database information to reconcile and populate newly launched
# courses. We still want to move in the direction of having some key actions, such as creating
# a new LTI linked Canvas assignment (e.g. a Project) be done from the platform UI so that we
# have more programmatic control of what happens, such as creating a resourceId for the LineItem
# so that we can uniquely identify an LTI linked resource after a course is copied in Canvas and
# the assignment IDs change, but we don't want to completely re-build all the Canvas UI stuff so
# folks will still be doing stuff in Canvas which means they could take an action that doesn't match
# our local database information (such as changing the title of an assignment), so the approach we're
# moving towards is having this be able to both setup and sync the local database information from
# the Canvas course information.

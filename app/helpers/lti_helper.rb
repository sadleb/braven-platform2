  # TODO: we can also provide an activity_id and registration. These are ways to group xApi statements together.
  # I'm thinking each rise360_module_version or project has an activity_id to group the statements for that and then we have a
  # registration for the course to get all statements for a user for a particular course (in case they take multiple or drop and try again).
  # However, will we need a finer grained level to group statements than just project / rise360_module_version?

      # Actually, this means a single export that is imported into different courses needs the registration set so we can
      # pull data for that rise360_module_version just for the current course and not just any course.

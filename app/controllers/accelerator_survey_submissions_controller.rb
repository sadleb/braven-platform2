require 'form_assembly_api'

# We have Pre- and Post-Accelerator Surveys that Fellows respond to at the
# beginning and end of the course. These surveys are built on FormAssembly, like
# waivers (see WaiverSubmissionsController).
#
# This controller handles rendering (#new) and submitting (#create) the form
# for the survey. It allows the user to submit once and shows a "Thank You" page
# afterwards (#completed).
#
# This controller inherits from FormAssemblyController, which implements
# embedding the FormAssembly form in a view.
#
# It also includes the Submittable concern, which handles creating the
# submission on Canvas using the LTI Advantage API, as well as redirecting to
# #completed once a submission exists.
#
# In order for these surveys to work, you will need to configure the following:
#
#   - FormAssembly surveys
#     - Survey for pre-accelerator
#     - Survey for post-accelerator
#
#   - FormAssembly survey connectors (for each survey)
#     - Post Redirect: to the #create endpoint
#     - Salesforce: to write responses back to Salesforce
#
#   - Salesforce Program
#     - Highlander Accelerator Course ID: your Playground Canvas Course ID
#     - FA ID Fellow PreSurvey: FormAssembly survey for pre-accelerator ID
#     - FA ID Fellow PostSurvey: FormAssembly survey for post-accelerator ID
#
# For logic that handles publishing and unpublishing these surveys as Canvas
# Assignments, see AcceleratorSurveysController.

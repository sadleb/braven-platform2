# Endpoint to handle Honeycomb instrumentation sent from Javascript
#
# Inspriation taken from these repos and the Honeycomb beeline source:
#  - https://github.com/carwow/honeykiq
#  - https://github.com/thewoolleyman/honeycomb-react-rails-fullstack-tracing
#
# Note: we have some Honeycomb wrapper classes in honeycomb.js to help with sending
# Boomerang events from Javasript to this controller. They are mostly meant for helping 
# to make sure the instrumentation you add ends up in a Boomerang beacon that makes 
# sense as a "span". HOWEVER, this controller is the one mostly responsible for translating built-in
# Boomerang field names / values into normalized field names / values that match the rest of
# the Rails Honeycomb Beeline instrumentation to allow us to easily query for and analyze the data.

  # Slightly undocumented header to use to propagate traces in a distributed fashion.
  # I noticed this mentioned in the docs about Faraday doing this: https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/ruby/beeline/#faraday
  # and dug into the code to do the same. One example here: 
  #   https://github.com/honeycombio/beeline-ruby/blob/6db9d6e0f696d93212100cca5efdeefc7723afb7/lib/honeycomb/integrations/faraday.rb#L25
  # This is where Beeline uses it to setup the trace and spans in the current context:
  #   https://github.com/honeycombio/beeline-ruby/blob/6db9d6e0f696d93212100cca5efdeefc7723afb7/lib/honeycomb/integrations/rack.rb#L35
  X_HONEYCOMB_TRACE_HEADER = 'X-Honeycomb-Trace'

  # Takes a span from Javascript and sends it to Honeycomb. The trace for the controller that
  # that rendered the page must be serialized in the 'X-Honeycomb-Trace' header so that we can
  # add this span as a child of that trace.
  #
  # Note: Honeycomb Beeline looks for this header and uses it to setup the traces and spans that are
  # auto-instrumented. If you try and directly setup the trace_id and parent_id without using this header,
  # the spans in this trace won't be in the same trace as the serialized one.
  #
  # Note: we made an active decision not to whitelist incoming params and just let everything through.
  # You have to be logged in (or have a valid state param for the session) to hit this controller,
  # so only registered users will be able to hit this. If one of our users decides to send random
  # stuff from the browser console or a script, we're logging their user info so we can chat with them and worst case
  # is we have to ask Honeycomb to purge a bunch of fields that we don't want (or just let them go stale)

  # The time that the event completed on the client side (as reported based on the client's clock).
  # Boomerang sends the number of seconds and milliseconds since the Epoch. Divide by 1000
  # to get seconds with fractional milliseconds like Time expects.
  #
  # Note: don't use the client side timestamp as the actual timestamp of the event
  # b/c the user's clock may be skewed by minutes, hours, or even days. The Honeycomb
  # JS instrumentation docs mention that is their experience. Putting this here so we can
  # get a sense of how much impact the network and rails server processing time is impacting
  # any gaps that show up in our traces. The JS span duration's should be accurate, but the
  # timestamp will be when the server received the event and not when the client says the event
  # happened.
  #
  # The time format used is the same in libhoney: 
  # https://github.com/honeycombio/libhoney-rb/blob/3607446da676a59aad47ff72c3e8d749f885f0e9/lib/libhoney/transmission.rb#L187

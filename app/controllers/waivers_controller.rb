# Handles publishing and unpublishing Waivers forms that Fellows need to sign
# in order to participate in the course.
#
# The waivers forms are created in FormAssembly. Here is one example: https://braven.tfaforms.net/forms/builder/5.0.0/4810809
# We configure the a Post Redirect connector on form submission and point it at https://platform.bebraven.org/waiver_submissions
# In the Connetor.
#
# Note: the FormAssembly e-Signature functionality requires access to cookies/local storage.
# This doesn't work in Chrome incognito (and probably Firefox) b/c they disable third party cookies
# by default. To get around this, we start with a launch view where you click a link to bring you
# to the platform app instead of being inside an iFrame in Canvas. We serve the FormAssembly
# form from our domain using their Rest API: https://help.formassembly.com/help/340360-use-a-server-side-script-api
# so that everything works.
#
# After publishing the waivers. The actual launch and submission are handled by WaiverSubmissionsController
class WaiversController < ApplicationController
  include DryCrud::Controllers::Nestable

  # Adds the #publish and #unpublish actions
  include Publishable

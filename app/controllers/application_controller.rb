  # We have two main entry points for the Braven apps when signing in, either
  # Canvas or the Platform. The Platform is only meant for staff (aka admin role)
  # and Canvas is meant for everyone else. Since we currently only have
  # Admin tools available when logging in directly, anyone who signs in to
  # a platform page directly who isn't staff should be sent to Canvas instead b/c
  # that's the most likely place they're trying to go and we have edge cases that
  # end up at the login path which would show "Not Authorized" if we send them to
  # the root platform path like we did by default before. One scenario I know about
  # is if the service param gets messed for /cas/login b/c you enter invalid creds.
  # Usually, login should redirect to the service param without hitting this.
  #
  # Note: there is similar redirect logic that uses CasHelper#default_service_url_for(user)
  # which is slighty different from this. This is the final target path we send them
  # to after login while that is to decide the CAS service that should handle SSO
  # ticket negotiation. This ONLY APPLIES when trying to access a Platform page directly
  # and have to log in. This means that if you came from Canvas or use a Canvas SSO
  # login service, the CAS SSO stuff will send you back to Canvas without hitting this.

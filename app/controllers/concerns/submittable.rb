# frozen_string_literal: true

# "Submittable" behavior for controllers like SurveySubmissionsController
# and CapstoneEvaluationSubmissionsController.
#
# This concern heavily depends on DryCrud::Controllers::Nestable, and requires
# the including controller to be nested under one parent.
#
# Usage:
#
#   include DryCrud::Controllers::Nestable
#   include Submittable
#   nested_resource_of MyParentResource
#
# When using this concern, you must also define a method `answers_params_hash`
# in the including controller. For example:
#
#   def answers_params_hash
#     params.permit(:permitted_stuff).to_h
#   end
#
# The results of this hash are passed to MyModel.save_answers! in #create below.
# The model you're using the controller with must then implement `save_answers!`
# that takes in the answers_params_hash and saves the submission answers. Note
# that this concern doesn't care what the hash looks like, it just has to match
# what the model's `save_answers!` method accepts. For example, the answers hashes
# for SurveySubmission and CapstoneEvaluationSubmission look completely different.

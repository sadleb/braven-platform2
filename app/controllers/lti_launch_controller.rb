# Implement the LTI 1.3 Launch Flow. Here is a nice summary of that flow by Canvas, our LMS:
# https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.lti_dev_key_config.html#launch-overview
#
# Summary of flow:
# Step 1: Login Initiation - Canvas calls into here letting us know a launch is starting
# Step 2: Authentication Response - We initiate an handshake to authenticate the launch establish a trust in the launch
# Step 3: LTI Launch - The launch is initated with meta-data about the context and the final target resource to launch
# Step 4: Resource Display - We display the target resource

# A base controller for all FormAssembly controllers to inherit from.
# Provides common utilities and CSS styles.

# When inheriting this, you must add the following methods on the controller
# in order to use the methods it provides:

# Usage:
# class MyController < FormAssemblyController
#  attr_reader :course, :lti_launch
# end
class FormAssemblyController < ApplicationController
